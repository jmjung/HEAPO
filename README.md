HEAPO
-----
we developed a heap-based persistent object store, HEAPO, to manage persistent objects in byte-addressable NVRAM. HEAPO defines its own persistent heap layout, the persistent object format, name space organization, object sharing and protection mechanism, and undo-only log based crash recovery, all of which are effectively tailored for NVRAM. We put our effort into developing lightweight and flexible layer to exploit the DRAM-like access latency of NVRAM. To address this objective, we developed (i) native management layer for NVRAM to eliminate redundancy between in-core and on-disk copy of the metadata, (ii) expandable object format, (iii) burst trie based global name space with local name space caching, (iv) static address binding, and (v) minimal logging for undo-only crash recovery.
